You home tonight
And if I ever let you down, I?ll be the one who drives
You home tonight, you home tonight!

[Post-Chorus]
It's driving you down, it's driving you down
It's driving you down, it's driving you down
It's driving you down, 'cause it's driving you down
It's driving you, driving you down

[Bridge]
You don?t know a thing about this life
And you don?t know a thing about this life
And you don?t know a thing about this life
'Cause you don?t know a thing about me, you don?t know a thing

[Chorus]
And if you save my life, I?ll be the one who drives
You home tonight
And if I ever let you down, I?ll be the one who drives
You home tonight, you home tonight, you home tonight!

[Outro]
'Cause it's driving you down
'Cause it's driving you down
'Cause it's driving you down
'Cause it's driving you, driving you, driving you down
