I said, we'll drown ourselves in misery tonight
White lies, you've worn out all your dancing shoes this time
Just give us war-worn lipstick, blood, and purifying flame
These eyes have had too much to drink again tonight
Black skies, we'll douse ourselves in high-explosive lies
Just give us war-worn, I've been calling you all week
For my shotgun
Pick up the phone
Pick up the phone, fucker
I want to see what your insides look like (I want to see what your insides look like)
I bet you're not fucking pretty on the inside (Not so pretty)
I want to see what your insides look like (Not so pretty baby)
I want to see them (Not so)
Well, you don't say
And well I can explain what happened to my face
Late last night
I sleep in empty pools and vacant alleyways
And what I'm going through, shot lip gloss through my veins
And well I can't complain

I want to see what your insides look like (I want to see what your insides look like)
I bet you're not fucking pretty on the inside (Not so pretty)
I want to see what your insides look like (Not so pretty baby)
I want to see them (Not so)
Well, you don't say
And well I can explain what happened to my face
Late last night
I sleep in empty pools and vacant alleyways
And what I'm going through, shot lip gloss through my veins
And well I can't complain
With the falling rain
Come on

[Outro]
I want to see your eyes
I want to see what your insides may be like




[Verse]
I said, we'll drown ourselves in misery tonight
White lies, you've worn out all your dancing shoes this time
Just give us war-worn lipstick, blood, and purifying flame
These eyes have had too much to drink again tonight
Black skies, we'll douse ourselves in high-explosive lies
Just give us war-worn, I've been calling you all week
For my shotgun
Pick up the phone
Pick up the phone, fucker
I want to see what your insides look like (I want to see what your insides look like)
I bet you're not fucking pretty on the inside (Not so pretty)
I want to see what your insides look like (Not so pretty baby)
I want to see them (Not so)
Well, you don't say
And well I can explain what happened to my face
Late last night
I sleep in empty pools and vacant alleyways
And what I'm going through, shot lip gloss through my veins
And well I can't complain
With the falling rain
