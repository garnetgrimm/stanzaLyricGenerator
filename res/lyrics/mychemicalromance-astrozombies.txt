

[Intro]
Whoa, all I want to know
All I want

[Verse 1]
With just a touch of my burning hand
I send my astro zombies to rape the land
Prime directive, exterminate
The whole human race
And your face just drops in a pile of flesh
And then your heart, heart pounds
Till it pumps in death
Prime directive, exterminate
Whatever stands left

[Chorus]
All I want to say
And all I gotta do
Who'd I do this for
Hey, me or you

And all I want to say
And all I gotta do
Who'd I do this for
Hey, me or you

[Bridge]
Whoa, all I want to know
All I want

[Verse 2]
With just a touch of my burning hand
I'm going to live my life to destroy your world
Prime directive, exterminate
The whole fucking race
And your face just drops in a pile of flesh
And then your heart, heart pounds
Till it pumps in death
Prime directive, exterminate
The whole fucking place, well

[Chorus]
All I want to say
And all I got to do
Who'd I do this for
Hey, me or you

And all I want to say
And all I got to do
Who'd I do this for
Hey, me or you

[Outro]
Whoa, all I want to know
All I want to know
All I want to know
All I want
(Go)
