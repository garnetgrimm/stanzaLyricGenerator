Hey, I'm, I'm doing a cover of My Chemical Romance
It's called Cancer
I hope you enjoy,?I?put a lot?of work into it
Alright

[Verse 1]
Turn away, if?you could get me a drink
Of water, 'cause my lips?are?chapped?and faded
Call my?Aunt Marie, help?her gather all my things
And bury me in all my favorite colors
My sisters and my brothers, still, I will not kiss you
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
Alright

[Verse 2]
Now turn away, 'cause I'm awful just to see
'Cause all my hair's abandoned all my body
Oh, my agony, know that I will never marry
Baby, I'm just soggy from the chemo
And but counting down the days to go, it just ain't living (laughs)

[Outro]
That if you say goodbye to me
I'd ask you to be true
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you...
Dope, that was epic

'Cause all my hair's abandoned all my body
Oh, my agony, know that I will never marry
Baby, I'm just soggy from the chemo
And but counting down the days to go, it just ain't living (laughs)

[Outro]
That if you say goodbye to me
I'd ask you to be true
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you...
Dope, that was epic

Hey, I'm, I'm doing a cover of My Chemical Romance
It's called Cancer
I hope you enjoy,?I?put a lot?of work into it
Alright

[Verse 1]
Turn away, if?you could get me a drink
Of water, 'cause my lips?are?chapped?and faded
Call my?Aunt Marie, help?her gather all my things
And bury me in all my favorite colors
My sisters and my brothers, still, I will not kiss you
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
Alright

[Verse 2]
Now turn away, 'cause I'm awful just to see
'Cause all my hair's abandoned all my body
Oh, my agony, know that I will never marry
Baby, I'm just soggy from the chemo
And but counting down the days to go, it just ain't living (laughs)
