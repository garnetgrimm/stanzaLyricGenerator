Yeah I drink juice when I'm killing cause it's fucking delicious
Hanging in the party down with Tommy Chong
When up came the day when karate was young

[Chorus]
I got a medical emergency
A medical emergency
We got a medical emergency
A medical emergency

[Bridge]
Switching out my style bring a friend out with
Better grab your soul from the fingers of death

[Chorus]
I got a medical emergency
A medical emergency
We got a medical emergency
A medical emergency

Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa

1-2-3-4
Bass!
1-2-3-4

Hanging in the party down with Tommy Chong
Take me to a time when karate was young

[Chorus]
I got a medical emergency
A medical emergency
We got a medical emergency
A medical emergency

(Whoaaaaa)
(Whoaaaaa)
(Whoaaaaa)
(Whoaaaaa)

[Outro]
We got a medical emergency
A medical emergency
