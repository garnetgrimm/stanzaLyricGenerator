We could be perfect one last night
And die like star-crossed lovers when we fight
And we could settle this affair
If you would shed your yellow
Take my hand and then

We'll solve
The mystery of laceration gravity
This riddle, of revenge
Please understand that it has to be this way

(Chorus)
Stand, up fucking tall
Don't let them see your back
And take, my fucking hand
And never be afraid again

(Verse 2)
We've only got one chance to put things at an end
And cross the patron saint of switchblade fights
You said, "We're not celebrities
We spark and fade, they die by threes"
I'll make you, understand
And you can trade me for an apparition

(Chorus)
Stand, up fucking tall
Don't let them see your back
And take, my fucking hand
And never

Trust, you said
Who put the words in your head?
Oh how wrong we were to think
That immortality meant never dying

(Outro)
Stand, take my fucking hand
Take my fucking

Stand up fucking tall, don't let them see your back
Take, my fucking hand
And never be afraid again

Just because my hand's around your fucking throat!

(Verse 2)
We've only got one chance to put things at an end
And cross the patron saint of switchblade fights
You said, "We're not celebrities
We spark and fade, they die by threes"
I'll make you, understand
And you can trade me for an apparition

(Chorus)
Stand, up fucking tall
Don't let them see your back
And take, my fucking hand
And never

(Verse 3)
Trust, you said
Who put the words in your head?
Oh how wrong we were to think
That immortality meant never dying

(Outro)
Stand, take my fucking hand
Take my fucking

Stand up fucking tall, don't let them see your back
Take, my fucking hand
And never be afraid again

Just because my hand's around your fucking throat!




(Verse 1)
We could be perfect one last night
And die like star-crossed lovers when we fight
And we could settle this affair
If you would shed your yellow
Take my hand and then

We'll solve
The mystery of laceration gravity
This riddle, of revenge
Please understand that it has to be this way

Stand, up fucking tall
Don't let them see your back
And take, my fucking hand

Oh how wrong we were to think
That immortality meant never dying

(Outro)
Stand, take my fucking hand
Take my fucking

Stand up fucking tall, don't let them see your back
Take, my fucking hand
And never be afraid again

Just because my hand's around your fucking throat!




(Verse 1)
We could be perfect one last night
And die like star-crossed lovers when we fight
And we could settle this affair
If you would shed your yellow
Take my hand and then

We'll solve
The mystery of laceration gravity
This riddle, of revenge
Please understand that it has to be this way

(Chorus)
Stand, up fucking tall
Don't let them see your back
And take, my fucking hand
And never be afraid again

(Verse 2)
We've only got one chance to put things at an end
And cross the patron saint of switchblade fights
You said, "We're not celebrities
We spark and fade, they die by threes"
I'll make you, understand
And you can trade me for an apparition

(Chorus)
Stand, up fucking tall
Don't let them see your back
And take, my fucking hand
And never

(Verse 3)
Trust, you said
Who put the words in your head?
Oh how wrong we were to think
That immortality meant never dying

(Outro)
Stand, take my fucking hand
Take my fucking

Stand up fucking tall, don't let them see your back
Take, my fucking hand
And never be afraid again

Just because my hand's around your fucking throat!




(Verse 1)
We could be perfect one last night
And die like star-crossed lovers when we fight
