

[Verse 1]
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me
Off guard, red handed, now I'm far from lonely
Asleep, I still see you lying next to me
So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me, ahh

[Verse 2]
I need something else, would someone please just give me
Hit me, and knock me out and let me go back to sleep?
I can't laugh all I want, inside I still am empty
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

[Verse 3]
I guess I remember every glance you shot me
Unharmed, I'm losing weight and some body-heat
I squoze so hard, I stopped your heart from beating
So deep that I didn't even scream, fuck me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

Yeah, it's all that I've got
So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me
So deep that I didn't even scream
Well if you wanted honesty
That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Verse 2]
What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Bridge]
Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay now (I'm okay now)
But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay! (Trust me)

For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Verse 2]
What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Bridge]
Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay now (I'm okay now)
But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay! (Trust me)

[Verse 1]
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me
Off guard, red handed, now I'm far from lonely
Asleep, I still see you lying next to me
So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me, ahh

[Verse 2]
I need something else, would someone please just give me
Hit me, and knock me out and let me go back to sleep?
I can't laugh all I want, inside I still am empty
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

[Verse 3]
I guess I remember every glance you shot me
Unharmed, I'm losing weight and some body-heat
I squoze so hard, I stopped your heart from beating
So deep that I didn't even scream, fuck me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not

Hit me, and knock me out and let me go back to sleep?
I can't laugh all I want, inside I still am empty
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

[Verse 3]
I guess I remember every glance you shot me
Unharmed, I'm losing weight and some body-heat
I squoze so hard, I stopped your heart from beating
So deep that I didn't even scream, fuck me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not

Yeah, it's all that I've got
Yeah, it's all that I've got
So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me
So deep that I didn't even scream
Well if you wanted honesty
That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Verse 2]
What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Bridge]
Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay now (I'm okay now)
But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay! (Trust me)

[Verse 2]
What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Bridge]
Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay now (I'm okay now)
But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay! (Trust me)

[Verse 1]
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me
Off guard, red handed, now I'm far from lonely
Asleep, I still see you lying next to me
So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me, ahh

[Verse 2]
I need something else, would someone please just give me
Hit me, and knock me out and let me go back to sleep?
I can't laugh all I want, inside I still am empty
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

[Verse 3]
I guess I remember every glance you shot me
Unharmed, I'm losing weight and some body-heat
I squoze so hard, I stopped your heart from beating
So deep that I didn't even scream, fuck me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not

So deep that I didn't even scream
Well if you wanted honesty
That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?

And it's all that I've got
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

[Verse 3]
I guess I remember every glance you shot me
Unharmed, I'm losing weight and some body-heat
I squoze so hard, I stopped your heart from beating
So deep that I didn't even scream, fuck me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

Yeah, it's all that I've got
Yeah, it's all that I've got
Yeah, it's all that I've got
So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me
So deep that I didn't even scream
Well if you wanted honesty
That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Verse 2]
What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Bridge]
Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay now (I'm okay now)
But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay! (Trust me)

Off guard, red handed, now I'm far from lonely
Asleep, I still see you lying next to me
So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me, ahh

[Verse 2]
I need something else, would someone please just give me
Hit me, and knock me out and let me go back to sleep?
I can't laugh all I want, inside I still am empty
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not

I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Bridge]
Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay now (I'm okay now)
But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay! (Trust me)

[Verse 1]
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me
Off guard, red handed, now I'm far from lonely
Asleep, I still see you lying next to me
So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me, ahh

[Verse 2]
I need something else, would someone please just give me
Hit me, and knock me out and let me go back to sleep?
I can't laugh all I want, inside I still am empty
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

[Verse 3]
I guess I remember every glance you shot me
Unharmed, I'm losing weight and some body-heat
I squoze so hard, I stopped your heart from beating
So deep that I didn't even scream, fuck me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely

So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me
So deep that I didn't even scream
Well if you wanted honesty
That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Verse 2]
What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook

Unharmed, I'm losing weight and some body-heat
I squoze so hard, I stopped your heart from beating
So deep that I didn't even scream, fuck me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

[Bridge]
Yeah, it's all that I've got
Yeah, it's all that I've got
Yeah, it's all that I've got
Yeah, it's all that I've got
Yeah, it's all that I've got
So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me
So deep that I didn't even scream
Well if you wanted honesty
That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Verse 2]
What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Bridge]
Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay now (I'm okay now)
But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay! (Trust me)

So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me
Off guard, red handed, now I'm far from lonely
Asleep, I still see you lying next to me
So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me, ahh

[Verse 2]
I need something else, would someone please just give me
Hit me, and knock me out and let me go back to sleep?
I can't laugh all I want, inside I still am empty
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not

The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay now (I'm okay now)
But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay! (Trust me)

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
Well, I'm not okay

Really Not Okay
I'm not okay

[Verse 1]
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me
Off guard, red handed, now I'm far from lonely
Asleep, I still see you lying next to me
So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me, ahh

[Verse 2]
I need something else, would someone please just give me
Hit me, and knock me out and let me go back to sleep?
I can't laugh all I want, inside I still am empty
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

[Verse 3]
I guess I remember every glance you shot me
Unharmed, I'm losing weight and some body-heat
I squoze so hard, I stopped your heart from beating
So deep that I didn't even scream, fuck me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not

Yeah, it's all that I've got
So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me
So deep that I didn't even scream
Well if you wanted honesty
That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Verse 2]
What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

And it's all that I've got
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

[Bridge]
Yeah, it's all that I've got
Yeah, it's all that I've got
Yeah, it's all that I've got
Yeah, it's all that I've got
Yeah, it's all that I've got
So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me
So deep that I didn't even scream
Well if you wanted honesty
That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Verse 2]
What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Bridge]
Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay now (I'm okay now)
But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay! (Trust me)

So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me
Off guard, red handed, now I'm far from lonely
Asleep, I still see you lying next to me
So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me, ahh

[Verse 2]
I need something else, would someone please just give me
Hit me, and knock me out and let me go back to sleep?
I can't laugh all I want, inside I still am empty
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

[Verse 3]
I guess I remember every glance you shot me
Unharmed, I'm losing weight and some body-heat
I squoze so hard, I stopped your heart from beating
So deep that I didn't even scream, fuck me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine

[Verse 1]
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me
Off guard, red handed, now I'm far from lonely
Asleep, I still see you lying next to me
So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me, ahh

[Verse 2]
I need something else, would someone please just give me
Hit me, and knock me out and let me go back to sleep?
I can't laugh all I want, inside I still am empty
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

[Verse 3]
I guess I remember every glance you shot me
Unharmed, I'm losing weight and some body-heat
I squoze so hard, I stopped your heart from beating
So deep that I didn't even scream, fuck me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not

So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me
So deep that I didn't even scream
Well if you wanted honesty
That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Verse 2]
What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Bridge]
Forget about the dirty looks

You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed

Yeah, it's all that I've got
Yeah, it's all that I've got
Yeah, it's all that I've got
Yeah, it's all that I've got
So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me
So deep that I didn't even scream
Well if you wanted honesty
That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Verse 2]
What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Bridge]
Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay now (I'm okay now)
But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay! (Trust me)

So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me
Off guard, red handed, now I'm far from lonely
Asleep, I still see you lying next to me
So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me, ahh

[Verse 2]
I need something else, would someone please just give me
Hit me, and knock me out and let me go back to sleep?
I can't laugh all I want, inside I still am empty
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

[Verse 3]
I guess I remember every glance you shot me
Unharmed, I'm losing weight and some body-heat
I squoze so hard, I stopped your heart from beating
So deep that I didn't even scream, fuck me, ahh

I'm not okay
I'm not okay




[Verse 1]
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me
Off guard, red handed, now I'm far from lonely
Asleep, I still see you lying next to me
So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me, ahh

[Verse 2]
I need something else, would someone please just give me
Hit me, and knock me out and let me go back to sleep?
I can't laugh all I want, inside I still am empty
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

[Verse 3]
I guess I remember every glance you shot me
Unharmed, I'm losing weight and some body-heat
I squoze so hard, I stopped your heart from beating
So deep that I didn't even scream, fuck me, ahh

[Chorus]
I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

Yeah, it's all that I've got
Yeah, it's all that I've got
So deep that it didn't even bleed, and catch me
So deep that I didn't even scream
Well if you wanted honesty
That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Verse 2]
What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Bridge]
Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay now (I'm okay now)
But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay! (Trust me)
