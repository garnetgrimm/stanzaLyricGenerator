

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Verse 1]
I got a bulletproof heart
You got a hollow-point smile
Me and your runaway scars got a photograph dream
On the getaway mile
Let's blow a hole in this town
And do our talking with a laser beam
Gunning out of this place in a bullet's embrace
Then we'll do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
How can they say
"Jenny,? could you come back home?"
Cause everybody knows you don't
Ever want to come back, let me be the one to save you!

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I'm shooting out of this room
Because I sure don't like the company
Stop your preaching right there, cause I really don't care
And I'll do it again
So get me out of my head
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
Because it's getting kind of cramped, you know
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
Coming ready or not, when the motor gets hot
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
We can do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
The papers say
"Johnny, won't you come back home?"
Cause everybody knows you don't
Want to give yourself up, tell the truth, and God will save you!

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Bridge]
And though I know how much you hate this
Are you going to be the one to save us
From the black and hopeless feeling?
Will you mean it when the end comes reeling?
Hold your heart into this darkness
Will it ever be the light to shine you out
Or fail and leave you stranded?
I'm not going to be the one left standing
You aren't going to be the one left standing
We aren't going to be the ones left standing

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
Is this our destiny? This world is after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, run away, run away, run away from here!
Yeah! Away from here, away from here




[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday

Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I'm shooting out of this room
Because I sure don't like the company
Stop your preaching right there, cause I really don't care
And I'll do it again
So get me out of my head
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
Because it's getting kind of cramped, you know
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
Coming ready or not, when the motor gets hot
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
We can do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
The papers say
"Johnny, won't you come back home?"
Cause everybody knows you don't
Want to give yourself up, tell the truth, and God will save you!

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Bridge]
And though I know how much you hate this
Are you going to be the one to save us
From the black and hopeless feeling?
Will you mean it when the end comes reeling?
Hold your heart into this darkness
Will it ever be the light to shine you out
Or fail and leave you stranded?
I'm not going to be the one left standing
You aren't going to be the one left standing
We aren't going to be the ones left standing

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
Is this our destiny? This world is after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, run away, run away, run away from here!
Yeah! Away from here, away from here




[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Verse 1]
I got a bulletproof heart
You got a hollow-point smile
Me and your runaway scars got a photograph dream
On the getaway mile
Let's blow a hole in this town
And do our talking with a laser beam
Gunning out of this place in a bullet's embrace
Then we'll do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
How can they say
"Jenny,? could you come back home?"
Cause everybody knows you don't
Ever want to come back, let me be the one to save you!

(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
We can do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
The papers say
"Johnny, won't you come back home?"
Cause everybody knows you don't
Want to give yourself up, tell the truth, and God will save you!

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Bridge]
And though I know how much you hate this
Are you going to be the one to save us
From the black and hopeless feeling?
Will you mean it when the end comes reeling?
Hold your heart into this darkness
Will it ever be the light to shine you out
Or fail and leave you stranded?
I'm not going to be the one left standing
You aren't going to be the one left standing
We aren't going to be the ones left standing

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
Is this our destiny? This world is after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, run away, run away, run away from here!
Yeah! Away from here, away from here




[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Verse 1]
I got a bulletproof heart
You got a hollow-point smile
Me and your runaway scars got a photograph dream
On the getaway mile
Let's blow a hole in this town
And do our talking with a laser beam
Gunning out of this place in a bullet's embrace
Then we'll do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
How can they say
"Jenny,? could you come back home?"
Cause everybody knows you don't
Ever want to come back, let me be the one to save you!

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I'm shooting out of this room
Because I sure don't like the company
Stop your preaching right there, cause I really don't care
And I'll do it again
So get me out of my head
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
Because it's getting kind of cramped, you know
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
Coming ready or not, when the motor gets hot
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
We can do it again

Will you mean it when the end comes reeling?
Hold your heart into this darkness
Will it ever be the light to shine you out
Or fail and leave you stranded?
I'm not going to be the one left standing
You aren't going to be the one left standing
We aren't going to be the ones left standing

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
Is this our destiny? This world is after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, run away, run away, run away from here!
Yeah! Away from here, away from here




[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Verse 1]
I got a bulletproof heart
You got a hollow-point smile
Me and your runaway scars got a photograph dream
On the getaway mile
Let's blow a hole in this town
And do our talking with a laser beam
Gunning out of this place in a bullet's embrace
Then we'll do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
How can they say
"Jenny,? could you come back home?"
Cause everybody knows you don't
Ever want to come back, let me be the one to save you!

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I'm shooting out of this room
Because I sure don't like the company
Stop your preaching right there, cause I really don't care
And I'll do it again
So get me out of my head
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
Because it's getting kind of cramped, you know
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
Coming ready or not, when the motor gets hot
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
We can do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
The papers say
"Johnny, won't you come back home?"
Cause everybody knows you don't
Want to give yourself up, tell the truth, and God will save you!

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Verse 1]
I got a bulletproof heart
You got a hollow-point smile
Me and your runaway scars got a photograph dream
On the getaway mile
Let's blow a hole in this town
And do our talking with a laser beam
Gunning out of this place in a bullet's embrace
Then we'll do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
How can they say
"Jenny,? could you come back home?"
Cause everybody knows you don't
Ever want to come back, let me be the one to save you!

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I'm shooting out of this room
Because I sure don't like the company
Stop your preaching right there, cause I really don't care
And I'll do it again
So get me out of my head
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
Because it's getting kind of cramped, you know
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
Coming ready or not, when the motor gets hot
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
We can do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
The papers say
"Johnny, won't you come back home?"
Cause everybody knows you don't
Want to give yourself up, tell the truth, and God will save you!

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Bridge]
And though I know how much you hate this
Are you going to be the one to save us
From the black and hopeless feeling?
Will you mean it when the end comes reeling?
Hold your heart into this darkness
Will it ever be the light to shine you out
Or fail and leave you stranded?
I'm not going to be the one left standing
You aren't going to be the one left standing
We aren't going to be the ones left standing

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
Is this our destiny? This world is after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, run away, run away, run away from here!
Yeah! Away from here, away from here




[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday

Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I'm shooting out of this room
Because I sure don't like the company
Stop your preaching right there, cause I really don't care
And I'll do it again
So get me out of my head
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
Because it's getting kind of cramped, you know
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
Coming ready or not, when the motor gets hot
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
We can do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
The papers say
"Johnny, won't you come back home?"
Cause everybody knows you don't
Want to give yourself up, tell the truth, and God will save you!

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Bridge]
And though I know how much you hate this
Are you going to be the one to save us
From the black and hopeless feeling?
Will you mean it when the end comes reeling?
Hold your heart into this darkness
Will it ever be the light to shine you out
Or fail and leave you stranded?
I'm not going to be the one left standing
You aren't going to be the one left standing
We aren't going to be the ones left standing

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
Is this our destiny? This world is after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, run away, run away, run away from here!
Yeah! Away from here, away from here




[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Verse 1]
I got a bulletproof heart
You got a hollow-point smile
Me and your runaway scars got a photograph dream
On the getaway mile
Let's blow a hole in this town
And do our talking with a laser beam
Gunning out of this place in a bullet's embrace
Then we'll do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
How can they say
"Jenny,? could you come back home?"
Cause everybody knows you don't
Ever want to come back, let me be the one to save you!

(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
We can do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
The papers say
"Johnny, won't you come back home?"
Cause everybody knows you don't
Want to give yourself up, tell the truth, and God will save you!

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Bridge]
And though I know how much you hate this
Are you going to be the one to save us
From the black and hopeless feeling?
Will you mean it when the end comes reeling?
Hold your heart into this darkness
Will it ever be the light to shine you out
Or fail and leave you stranded?
I'm not going to be the one left standing
You aren't going to be the one left standing
We aren't going to be the ones left standing

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
Is this our destiny? This world is after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, run away, run away, run away from here!
Yeah! Away from here, away from here




[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Verse 1]
I got a bulletproof heart
You got a hollow-point smile
Me and your runaway scars got a photograph dream
On the getaway mile
Let's blow a hole in this town
And do our talking with a laser beam
Gunning out of this place in a bullet's embrace
Then we'll do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
How can they say
"Jenny,? could you come back home?"
Cause everybody knows you don't
Ever want to come back, let me be the one to save you!

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I'm shooting out of this room
Because I sure don't like the company
Stop your preaching right there, cause I really don't care
And I'll do it again
So get me out of my head
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
Because it's getting kind of cramped, you know
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
Coming ready or not, when the motor gets hot
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
We can do it again

Will you mean it when the end comes reeling?
Hold your heart into this darkness
Will it ever be the light to shine you out
Or fail and leave you stranded?
I'm not going to be the one left standing
You aren't going to be the one left standing
We aren't going to be the ones left standing

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
Is this our destiny? This world is after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, run away, run away, run away from here!
Yeah! Away from here, away from here




[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Verse 1]
I got a bulletproof heart
You got a hollow-point smile
Me and your runaway scars got a photograph dream
On the getaway mile
Let's blow a hole in this town
And do our talking with a laser beam
Gunning out of this place in a bullet's embrace
Then we'll do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
How can they say
"Jenny,? could you come back home?"
Cause everybody knows you don't
Ever want to come back, let me be the one to save you!

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I'm shooting out of this room
Because I sure don't like the company
Stop your preaching right there, cause I really don't care
And I'll do it again
So get me out of my head
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
Because it's getting kind of cramped, you know
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
Coming ready or not, when the motor gets hot
(Who wants to rock, to rock, to rock? Let's go!)
We can do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
The papers say
"Johnny, won't you come back home?"
Cause everybody knows you don't
Want to give yourself up, tell the truth, and God will save you!

[Chorus]
Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be, these pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, if we could run away, run away from here!

[Bridge]
And though I know how much you hate this
Are you going to be the one to save us
From the black and hopeless feeling?
Will you mean it when the end comes reeling?
Hold your heart into this darkness
Will it ever be the light to shine you out
Or fail and leave you stranded?
I'm not going to be the one left standing
You aren't going to be the one left standing
We aren't going to be the ones left standing
