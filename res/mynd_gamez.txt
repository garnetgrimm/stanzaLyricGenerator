sacred mountains but horrid eveningâ€™s 
you say its over but im still screaming
i hope at some point youll see things my way
it doesnt have to be soon but some day

you say. your fine
then you change. your mind.
i think. its lame
and im giving up this game

watching cars as they pass through
my broken bones wont heal so soon
talking for hours wont change your view
you looked so broken when I saw YOUUU..

but you say. your fine
then you change. your mind.
ive been. so blind.
you were never mine

IM CHANGING
YOUR CHANGING
WERE GROWING ALL THE TIME
IM FINE
YOUR FINE
CANT YOU JUST SAY GOODBYE

IM CHANGING
YOUR CHANGING
WERE GROWING ALL THE TIME
IM FINE
YOUR FINE
DONT WANT TO SAY GOODBYE
